## Notes

- Created with CodeSandbox;
- I am using `create-react-app`, in real life I would either go with Vite if we want to stick with a SPA or Next.js if we need SSR;
- We could use Storybook to vizualize each component independently;
- `Heading`: we could have a global context to detect the right heading level;
- `Text`: we could support more semantic tags sucgh as `strong` or `em`;
- We could explore new viewport units to avoif the `-webkit-fill-available` trick;
